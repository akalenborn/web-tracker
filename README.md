# Webtracker
The current repository represents a conceptual prototype of a webbased geolocation system.
It includes the javascript functionality of the Geolocation API and provides serveral graphical illustrations such as by the use of the OpenStreetMap-Service connected to the library of Leafet. In the role of a progressive web application, the webbased geolocation system offers its functions during the offline mode.

The main function-data is build by the main.js, which preserves all geolocation functionalities called in the index
